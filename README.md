## General Information
- ablu is an experiment in designing online bidding platforms. It is the lowest unique bid auction reimagined in a game context with overly simple buttons. The winner of the auction is the person who selects the lowest unique square, hence why it is called a lowest unique bid auction. There is interesting game theory behind this type of auction, resulting in a dominant strategy that actually makes this a strategic game, though it may seem only winnable by chance.

## Technologies Used
- React - version 17.0.2
- Firebase - version 9.0.1


## Features
- Login / signup capabilities
- Waiting rooms for live events
- Place bids in timed auction and see board change in real time to reflect status
